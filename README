FOOTBALL AND MANAGER


We are looking for managers. This is a web based football manager game.

What you need is:
* node.js
* twitter bootstrap
* jquery

Good points to read for beginning all these stuff:


- Bootstrap: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap
Good stuff for responsive and easy design even for non designers like us. You only specify the grids and put things into these containers of the grids.

- Bootstrap Ajax: https://github.com/eldarion/bootstrap-ajax
Bootstrap is good for responsive design but I don't know if it supports ajax natively. So I looked up and I found this. This plugin takes the 'form' element and stops the synchronous request. Then makes the request asynch type ajax. You only need to define form class as "form ajax"

- node.js: http://nodejs.org/
* proces.cwd() gives you "Current Working Directory" (cwd) : http://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_cwd
* url.parse(urlStr) parses the url so you can easily get the path and filenames on this url : http://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_parse_urlstr_parsequerystring_slashesdenotehost
* fs.readFile(filename) lets you read the files on your file system. so you can serve static files like html, css and js (for client-side) : http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_filename_encoding_callback
* path.join() I don't know what makes this handy or useful. I used it just because of the Next Point : http://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_join_path1_path2

- (Next Point) static server; if we have a nodejs application, we can use it as a static file server too. Someone did it pretty so I got what dropped to my "pay" : https://gist.github.com/701407
